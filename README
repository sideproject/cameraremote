Nerdkit Camera Remote

This is the code to control a home-made IR remote for my Nikon D40.  There is code written to handle Canon cameras but it is untested.

It can operate in two modes:
	1. Remote Capture - Take a picture each time the trigger button is pushed
	2. Intervalometer - Take a picture every X seconds/minutes (time lapse)

CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE:
The code and Nerdkit designs used in this project are (very) heavily influenced by Josh Davis's Nerdkit Intervalometer project:
