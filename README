The code in this project is heavily influenced by Josh Davis's code found at http://thedavisblog.com/blog/?p=708

To change camera types, change the mode variable from NIKON to CANON.

----------------README FROM ORIGINAL AUTHER----------------
Nerdkit Intervalometer
by Josh Davis


The Makefile is set up to make a Nikon remote/intervalometer.
If you want to make the Canon version, replace all the "nikon" with "canon"
The Canon shutter release pattern is untested so I can't guarantee it will
work.  Good Luck!

Any suggestions or comments can be forwarded to me at joshosu@gmail.com
